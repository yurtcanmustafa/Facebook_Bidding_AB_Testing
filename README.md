# Facebook_Bidding_AB_Testing

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, “average bidding”, as an alternative to its exisiting bidding type, called “maximum bidding”. One of our clients, bombabomba.com, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to understand if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding.

In this A/B test, bombabomba.com randomly splits its audience into two equally sized groups, e.g. the test and the control group. A Facebook ad campaign with “maximum bidding” is served to “control group” and another campaign with “average bidding” is served to the “test group”.

The A/B test has run for 1 month and bombabomba.com now expects you to analyze the results of this A/B test.
